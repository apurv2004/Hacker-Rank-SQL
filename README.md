**📘 HackerRank SQL Practice
📌 Overview**

This repository contains SQL practice exercises and solutions from HackerRank.
It includes a curated set of SQL query problems and corresponding solutions designed to reinforce fundamental database querying concepts.

This project demonstrates:

Structured problem solving with SQL

Understanding of relational data

Practical experience with SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and other key SQL constructs

**⚠️ Note: This repository focuses on SQL query practice and is not part of backend application development. It reflects learning in database querying, which complements backend skills.**
